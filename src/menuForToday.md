1. use the coders api to fetch some messages using useState  <done>

2. fetch the data in the component but store it in the redux store <done>

3. do everything in the redux layer and dispach actions to the store to get the data.<later today>




#why redux?!?!?!

1. make a api call once, use the data in all the differen components
2. sepparation of concerns: keep react as clean as possible,
                            keep the components as small as possible
                            small components are good readeble
3. all the "expensive" work is done by redux
4. move your app to react native very fast -> reuse a lot of code
5. prevent you from merging errors
